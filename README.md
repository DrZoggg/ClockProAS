Emerging evidence suggests that circadian misalignment contributes to an increased risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), yet its role in plaque microenvironment development remains poorly understood, limiting the development of targeted interventions. Current knowledge is largely derived from epidemiological studies and animal models; however, most human studies focus on healthy individuals, and animal models fail to fully recapitulate human pathophysiology. The challenge remains the accurate detection and quantification of endogenous circadian disturbances in human disease contexts. This study conducted a high-resolution systems biology analysis to decipher the molecular fingerprint of circadian disturbances in ASCVD progression. We integrated 4,088 publicly available transcriptomic samples from 44 independent datasets spanning multiple species and biological contexts. We analyzed four additional in-house cohorts from the Henan Province Clinical Research Center for Cardiovascular Diseases (CRCCD), including a blood transcriptomic cohort capturing ASCVD developmental trajectories and three human atherosclerotic plaque cohorts with bulk and single-cell data. We developed and validated MyPROClock, a robust system for precise detection and quantification of individual-specific endogenous circadian disruption. Leveraging this system, we uncovered macro-level clinical insights into the association between circadian misalignment and diverse clinical phenotypes, while also elucidating the underlying biological mechanisms driving atherosclerotic microenvironment remodeling and disease progression. MFAP4 emerged as a key mediator of circadian misalignment, driving smooth muscle cell phenotypic transitions and promoting plaque instability, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target for circadian-based interventions in ASCVD. To facilitate clinical translation, we integrated circadian biological heterogeneity into patient, introducing a reproducible ASCVD circadian classification with potential clinical utility. In parallel, we launched an AI-powered web application enabling physicians to stratify patients based on the severity of endogenous circadian disruption, facilitating personalized management adjustments. This study lays the groundwork for integrating circadian-informed strategies into clinical practice, supporting personalized management and precision therapeutics.
